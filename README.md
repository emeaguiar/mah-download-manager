# Mah Download Manager

## Simple download manager for WordPress

This plugin was created with **the only intention of serving as a working example** to one of [my tutorials](http://marioaguiar.net/blog/writing-a-download-manager-plugin-with-wordpress).

It's not supposed to be a real project and I *probably* won't give it any support.

## Features

* Upload and store files using WordPress' Filesystem API
* Creates and manages data in the database using WordPress' Database API
* Displays a list of the content using WordPress' Lists API
* Edit and delete existing files from the database using Database and Filesystem APIs

## Branches

The article has been divided in four parts to explain the process of each API, to make the tutorial easier to understand this repo is also divided in four brances, one for each API, and the final result.
