# Mah Download Manager

## UPDATE 2017

The plugin has been updated to show my new code patterns and things I have learned in the last few years, it no longer is an accurate representation of the tutorial.

If you came here through the article you can check out the master branch which will keep the old code, however, I don't recommend using it in prodcution environments.

I won't be giving any support to this plugin, so while I have updated it to new standards, I also don't recommend using this new version.

## Simple download manager for WordPress

This plugin was created with **the only intention of serving as a working example** to one of [my tutorials](http://marioaguiar.net/blog/writing-a-download-manager-plugin-with-wordpress).

It's not supposed to be a real project and I *probably* won't give it any support.

## Features

* Upload and store files using WordPress' Filesystem API
* Creates and manages data in the database using WordPress' Database API
* Displays a list of the content using WordPress' Lists API
* Edit and delete existing files from the database using Database and Filesystem APIs

## Branches

The article has been divided in four parts to explain the process of each API, to make the tutorial easier to understand this repo is also divided in four brances, one for each API, and the final result.
